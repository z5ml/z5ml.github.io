Welcome to my blog!

I'm quite new to this whole blog space, so it will take some getting used to haha.

Firstly, this blog was inspired Ivan's 366-day self study into Data and AI: https://ivanstudyblog.github.io/

The premise of the posts within this blog is that it will entail the objectives I had for the day ahead, a brief summary of the topics studied and the aims for the following day.

At the end of each week I will review my progress and aim to complete a mini project given what I have learned.

Once again, welcome to my journey. I hope to use this platform as a study/work journal and in the future, a professional portfolio
